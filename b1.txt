Hi Tom,
I’ve just got back from my holiday in Nha Trang. It was amazing! The beaches were beautiful, and I loved the food. The people were friendly, too. Would you like to see my photos? I can email them to you if you want.

1 .We had a big family party last weekend.... how do you think I could improve things with my family? 
Now write an email: 

Hi Nam,
I’m sorry to hear about your problems with your family. I usually get on really well with my parents, although we don’t agree about everything and sometimes have arguments. I’ve only got one brother, and we are very different. We don’t have much in common, but I’m fond of him and we don’t often argue. I think you should avoid serious discussions with your dad if you never agree. Little sisters can be difficult, but just be patient. I’m sure you’ll get on better when she grows up.
Take care and write soon,
Tam

2.Your teacher has asked you to write a story. Your story must begin with this sentence.
I saw the advert for a talent show and decided to apply.
Write your story?

I saw the advert for a talent show and decided to apply. At first, I was very nervous because I had never performed in front of so many people. My talent was singing, and I practiced every evening after school. On the day of the show, my hands were shaking, but when the music started, I forgot my fear. The audience listened quietly, and at the end they clapped loudly. I felt so proud and happy. Even though I didn’t win first prize, I gained confidence and made new friends. It was an experience I will never forget.

A new home

Last month, I went to visit my brother in his new flat. He has moved in a week before and had invited me for dinner.
When I arrived at the large apartment building, I rang the bell of the flat on the third floor, but no one answered. First, I thought he was out, so I decided to wait. Then, after an hour, I began to get check his address. I couldn’t believe it- he lived on the fourth floor!
I went upstairs immediately. Luckily, my brother and his flatmates found it funny, and we enjoyed a lovely dinner together.


Nói về du lịch
I have just returned from a wonderful trip to Da Nang. The city is located by the sea and surrounded by beautiful mountains. The streets are lively and full of tourists, but the traffic is still easy to move around. I stayed in a small hotel near the beach, which was very clean and comfortable. Every morning, I walked along the shore to enjoy the sunrise. I also visited Ba Na Hills, where the weather was cool and the view was amazing. To me, traveling is the best way to relax and discover new things.
Nói về quần áo
I like wearing comfortable clothes in my daily life. At home, I usually wear a simple T-shirt and shorts because they are light and easy to move in. When I go to school, I wear my uniform, which includes a white shirt and dark trousers. On special occasions, I choose nicer clothes such as a dress or a shirt with jeans, depending on the event. I also enjoy buying new clothes when I travel because each place has its own style. To me, clothes are not only for covering but also for showing personality and confidence.
Nói về công việc
I work in an office in the center of the city. Every day, I go to work at 8 a.m. and finish at 5 p.m. My job is mainly about writing reports, answering emails, and joining meetings with my team. The office is modern, with computers, air conditioning, and comfortable chairs. I like working with my colleagues because they are friendly and supportive. Sometimes the work is stressful, but I always try to stay positive and organized. To me, my office job is a good chance to learn, earn money, and improve my skills for the future.

I just moved to live in a two-story house on the outskirts of town. The streets are crowded with people but it has convenient traffic. My house is quite large and very clean. There is a living room, a kitchen, 3 bathrooms, and 3 bedrooms. The second floor is a reading room and a place of worship. Each room has its own design, depending on the preferences of each person. Next to the house is a small garden with vegetables and some flowers. To me, my house is a place where I feel the best in the world. How is your house? Tell me about your house in the next letter.
